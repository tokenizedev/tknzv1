  * Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
  * Public or private harassment
  * Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
  * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
