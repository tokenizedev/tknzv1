 # TKNZ (Tokenize) Chrome Extension

 TKNZ (pronounced "tokenize") is a Chrome extension that lets you create meme coins on Pump.fun directly from news articles and tweets. It provides a simple UI to manage a Solana wallet, extract article or tweet data (title, image, description) and generate token metadata, then launch tokens with a specified investment amount.

 ## Goals
 - Simplify the workflow for launching meme coins based on article or tweet content.
 - Abstract the complexity of Solana SPL token creation and metadata hosting.
 - Provide real-time SOL and token balance updates.
 - Integrate with Pump.fun for token creation and pools.
 - Track key events (balance updates, token launches) via Firebase (optional).
 - Support modern web apps and dynamic content (e.g., SPAs, Twitter/X posts).

 ## Features
 - Extract title, image, and description from articles and tweets.
 - Generate token metadata via an AI-powered Token Creation API.
 - Host metadata on IPFS through Pump.fun.
 - Create and fund Solana SPL tokens with a configurable investment amount.
 - View and refresh SOL and token balances.
 - Version checking and update prompts.
 - Analytics logging to Firestore (requires Firebase configuration).
 - Responsive UI built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand.

 ## Getting Started

 ### Prerequisites
 - Node.js >= 16.x
 - npm (>= 8.x) or yarn
 - Chrome or any Chromium-based browser

 ### Installation
 1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tokenizedev/tknzv1.git
    cd tknzv1
    ```
 2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
 3. Generate a private key for packaging (one-time):
    ```bash
    npm run keygen
    ```
    This creates `extension.pem` used by CRXJS for signing.

 ### Environment Variables
 Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
 ```ini
 VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<Your Firebase Web API Key>
 ```
 Optionally override the app version:
 ```ini
 VITE_APP_VERSION=0.2.3
 ```

 ## Development
 Start the Vite development server:
 ```bash
 npm run dev
 ```
 Load the extension as an unpacked extension:
 1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
 2. Enable **Developer mode**.
 3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project root.
 4. Click the TKNZ icon in the toolbar to open the popup.

 ## Build & Packaging
 Build for production:
 ```bash
 npm run build
 ```
 Package into a CRX file:
 ```bash
 npm run package
 ```
 Release (bump version, build, package):
 ```bash
 npm run release
 ```
 The generated `.crx` file will be in the project root.

 ## Chrome Extension Installation
 To install the packaged CRX:
 1. Drag and drop the `.crx` file into `chrome://extensions/`.
 2. Confirm installation.
 Alternatively, load the `dist/` folder as an unpacked extension.

 ## Scripts
 - `npm run dev`         — Start development server with HMR.
 - `npm run build`       — Build extension (includes TypeScript compile).
 - `npm run build:crx`   — Alias for build.
 - `npm run lint`        — Run ESLint.
 - `npm run preview`     — Preview the build locally.
 - `npm run bump`        — Bump version and create Git tag.
 - `npm run keygen`      — Generate `extension.pem` for packaging.
 - `npm run package`     — Package into CRX.
 - `npm run release`     — Build, bump version, and package.
 - `npm run test`        — Run unit tests in watch mode.
 - `npm run test:ci`     — Run tests once with coverage.
